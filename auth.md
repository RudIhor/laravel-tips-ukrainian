### Check Multiple Permissions at Once

In addition to `@can` Blade directive, did you know you can check multiple permissions at once with `@canany` directive?

```blade
@canany(['update', 'view', 'delete'], $post)
    // The current user can update, view, or delete the post
@elsecanany(['create'], \App\Post::class)
    // The current user can create a post
@endcanany
```

### Authenticate users with more options

If you only want to authenticate users that are also "activated", for example, it's as simple as passing an extra argument to `Auth::attempt()`.

No need for complex middleware or global scopes.

```php
Auth::attempt(
    [
        ...$request->only('email', 'password'),
        fn ($query) => $query->whereNotNull('activated_at')
    ],
    $this->boolean('remember')
);
```

### More Events on User Registration

Want to perform some actions after new user registration? Head to `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` and add more Listeners classes, and then in those classes implement `handle()` method with `$event->user` object

```php
class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    protected $listen = [
        Registered::class => [
            SendEmailVerificationNotification::class,

            // You can add any Listener class here
            // With handle() method inside of that class
        ],
    ];
```

### Did you know about Auth::once()?

You can login with user only for ONE REQUEST, using method `Auth::once()`.
No sessions or cookies will be utilized, which means this method may be helpful when building a stateless API.

```php
if (Auth::once($credentials)) {
    //
}
```

### Change API Token on users password update

It's convenient to change the user's API Token when its password changes.

Model:

```php
protected function password(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
            set: function ($value, $attributes) {
                $value = $value;
                $attributes['api_token'] = Str::random(100);
            }
        );
}
```

### Override Permissions for Super Admin

If you've defined your Gates but want to override all permissions for SUPER ADMIN user, to give that superadmin ALL permissions, you can intercept gates with `Gate::before()` statement, in `AuthServiceProvider.php` file.

```php
// Intercept any Gate and check if it's super admin
Gate::before(function($user, $ability) {
    if ($user->is_super_admin == 1) {
        return true;
    }
});

// Or if you use some permissions package...
Gate::before(function($user, $ability) {
    if ($user->hasPermission('root')) {
        return true;
    }
});
```

If you want to do something in your Gate when there is no user at all, you need to add a type hint for `$user` allowing it to be `null`. For example, if you have a role called Anonymous for your non-logged-in users:

```php
Gate::before(function (?User $user, $ability) {
    if ($user === null) {
        $role = Role::findByName('Anonymous');
        return $role->hasPermissionTo($ability) ? true : null;
    }
    return $user->hasRole('Super Admin') ? true : null;
});
```

### Custom Authentication Events

Laravel's authentication system fires various events during the authentication process, allowing you to hook into these events and perform additional actions or custom logic.

For example, you might want to log users Login.
You can achieve this by listening to the `Illuminate\Auth\Events\Login` event.

To implement it:
1. Create event listener classes for the events. You can generate these classes using Artisan commands:
```bash
php artisan make:listener LogSuccessfulLogin
```
2. Write the logic to execute when the events occur:
```php
// app/Listeners/LogSuccessfulLogin.php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Login;

class LogSuccessfulLogin
{
    public function handle(Login $event)
    {
        // Log the successful login
        Log::info("User with ID ".$event->user->id." successfully logged in.");
    }
}
```

For Laravel version 10.x or older, you need to register the newly created event listener manually:

3. Register your event listeners in the `EventServiceProvider`:
```php
// app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Auth\Events\Login;
use App\Listeners\LogSuccessfulLogin;

class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    protected $listen = [
        Login::class => [
            LogSuccessfulLogin::class,
        ]
    ];

    // Other event listeners...
}
```
Now, whenever a user logs in to your application, you can get noticed by checking the Laravel log file at `/storage/logs/laravel.log`.
